== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need an API key? =

Yes, you need a free API key from OpenWeatherMap. Sign up at [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api) - it only takes a minute and is completely free.

= How much does the API cost? =

The OpenWeatherMap free tier includes 1,000 API calls per day, which is more than enough for most websites. This plugin uses smart caching to minimize API usage.

= How often does the weather update? =

Weather data is cached for 30 minutes. After that, the next visitor will trigger a fresh update. This keeps your data current while respecting API limits.

= Can I show weather for multiple locations? =

Yes! Simply add multiple widget instances with different zip codes to display weather for different locations.

= What if my API key doesn't work? =

After signing up for an API key, it can take 10-15 minutes to activate. If it still doesn't work:
- Verify you copied the entire API key
- Check that your zip code is valid
- Ensure your country code is correct (2 letters, e.g., "US")

= Will this slow down my website? =

No. The plugin uses efficient caching and lightweight code. Weather data loads quickly and doesn't impact page performance.

= Can I customize the styling? =

Yes! The widget includes multiple CSS classes for easy customization. Add your custom CSS to Appearance â†’ Customize â†’ Additional CSS.

= Does it work with my theme? =

Yes! The plugin works with any WordPress theme that supports widgets.

= Does it work with page builders? =

Yes! The plugin works with any page builder that supports WordPress widgets (Elementor, WPBakery, Beaver Builder, etc.).

= What happens if I exceed the API limit? =

If you exceed 1,000 calls per day, the widget will show an error message until your quota resets at midnight UTC. The smart caching makes this very unlikely.

= Can I change the number of forecast days? =

The widget shows 5 days by default. You can modify the PHP code if you need fewer days.

= Is the sunset time accurate? =

Yes, sunset times are provided by OpenWeatherMap based on the location's coordinates and are accurate to the minute.
